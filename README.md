# Nepal Population Analysis Tool

## Overview  
The Nepal Population Analysis Tool is a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)-based** program designed to analyze population data from Nepalese provinces. It provides statistical insights and visualizations for predefined datasets stored as CSV files.

## Features & Functionalities  
- **Load Population Data** – Read predefined datasets from CSV files.  
- **Calculate Statistics** – Compute mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, IQR, and MAD.  
- **Generate Visualizations** – Display histograms and distribution plots.  
- **Save Analysis** – Store results for further reference.  
- **User-Friendly CLI** – Interactive menu for easy navigation.
