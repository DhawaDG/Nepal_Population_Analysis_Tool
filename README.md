***Overview***  
The Nepal Population Analysis Tool is a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)-based** program designed to analyze population data from Nepalese provinces. It provides statistical insights and visualizations for predefined datasets stored as CSV files.
---
***Features & Functionalities***  
- **Load Population Data** â€“ Read predefined datasets from CSV files.  
- **Calculate Statistics** â€“ Compute mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, IQR, and MAD.  
- **Generate Visualizations** â€“ Display histograms and distribution plots.  
- **Save Analysis** â€“ Store results for further reference.  
- **User-Friendly CLI** â€“ Interactive menu for easy navigation.  

---

***Technologies Used***  
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy.stats`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- **Data Processing**: CSV file handling with `pandas`  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation  
- **Visualization**: Histograms and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots
